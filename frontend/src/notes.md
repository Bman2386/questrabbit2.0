# TODO:
## improve readability/maintainability of code
     - organize css (each css file should be with component folder, except css resets)
     - ensure functions have explicit names * ex. change mini (in createQuest & questPage components to something more descriptive)
     - change backend from ex. adv_reviews to adventurer_reviews
     - write more comments explaining how things work
## Project Maintanence
- update redux store (current version is not latest & greatest)
- write tests
    - install rspec & jest
    - write tests to ensure all backend functions work as expected
    - write tests to ensure all frontend functions perform as expected
- add help modal
