# TODO:
## Improve Readability/Maintainability of Code
- organize css (each css file should be with component folder, except css resets)
- ensure functions and variables have explicit names 
    - ex. change mini (in createQuest & questPage components to something more descriptive)
    - change backend from ex. adv_reviews to adventurer_reviews
## Project Maintanence
- update redux store (current version is going to be depricated)
- write tests
    - install rspec & jest
    - write tests to ensure all frontend/backend functions work as expected
- add help modal
- add min loader display time
- useEffect is being depricated, find a fix
## @ Scale
- category and adventurer show will have to be re-worked
- Quest creation will need infinite scroll when browsing adventurers
- use faker gem to generate additional adventurers/reviews
